A simple heart Disease Prediction, done with a neural network

Attribute Information: 
> 1. age 
> 2. sex 
> 3. chest pain type (4 values) 
> 4. resting blood pressure 
> 5. serum cholestoral in mg/dl 
> 6. fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
> 7. resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
> 8. maximum heart rate achieved 
> 9. exercise induced angina 
> 10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest 
> 11. the slope of the peak exercise ST segment 
> 12. number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy 
> 13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect

Accuracy is ~85%

A neural network with 2 hidden layer of 6 nodes, input layer with 12 nodes and one output node. Output is binary which indicates the person could be or would be suffering from any heart diseases.
